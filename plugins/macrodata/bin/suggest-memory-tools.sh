# UserPromptSubmit hook — static reminder that recall tools exist.
#
# Replaces the prior ambient-memory.ts and ambient-memory-qmd.ts hooks, which
# ran retrieval on every prompt. Burn-in data showed both surfaced
# operationally-useful context on <10% of turns while paying 2–28s of latency.
# This hook nudges the model to call the recall tools intentionally instead.
#
# Costs ~one shell exec per prompt, no bun startup, no index reads.
#

read -r _stdin  # drain stdin so the harness doesn't see a broken pipe
