# Macrodata Local Hook Script
#
# Usage:
#   macrodata-hook.sh session-start  - Launch daemon, signal reload, converge the
#                                       ambient-recall worker, emit the first-run
#                                       onboarding nudge if unconfigured
#   macrodata-hook.sh prompt-submit  - Ensure the daemon and the recall worker are
#                                       up, inject any pending daemon-written
#                                       context
#   macrodata-hook.sh recall-worker  - Converge the recall worker alone
#   macrodata-hook.sh print-root     - Print the resolved state root
#
# Both long-lived processes macrodata owns — the daemon and the ambient-recall
# worker — are managed from here, on BOTH events. Running on every prompt is what
# makes an upgrade take effect: SessionStart fires on startup, resume, clear and
# compact, and a plugin update followed by a reload is none of those, so a manager
# registered only there serves the previous version's code until the human happens
# to open a new session.
#
# NOTE: session-start no longer composes the memory context here. Each state
# file is injected by its own compose-state-file.ts hook, journal+schedules by
# compose-lists.ts, USAGE by inject-usage.sh, and the files manifest by
# inject-files.sh — each in its own ~10K hook-output envelope (anthropics/
# claude-code#44086). This script only manages process lifecycles and the
# first-run nudge.

# processes.
#
# Ownership is scoped to the STATE ROOT, not to a checkout: every worker sharing a
# root drains the same mailbox, so two are always one too many. A worker serving a
# different root belongs to a different system and is never counted or reaped.
# Both facts are read off the worker's own argv, which is why it is spawned with a
# sentinel and a root it does not itself parse — the root there is a label for
# `ps`, and the worker resolves its real mailbox through getStateRoot() like every
# other entry point.
#
# That argv also says WHICH copy of the source a worker runs, since plugins install
# into a per-version directory:
#   1. this version's $RECALL_WORKER    -> up, nothing to do
#   2. another version's plugin cache   -> stale after an upgrade; reap, respawn

#      this runs on every prompt, so reaping it would kill a debug worker
#      mid-session. Leave it, spawn no competitor.
#
# Spawned directly via nohup (no shell wrapper) so one logical process = one PID,
# which keeps the reap honest. Case 2 is reaped whole; if case 1 somehow has
