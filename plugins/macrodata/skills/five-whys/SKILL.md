description: Structured root cause analysis for arriving at a concrete action. Use when something went wrong, a pattern keeps recurring, behavior has drifted, or you catch yourself resolving to "do better" / "remember to X" without a concrete artifact. Five-whys forces behavioral resolutions into file edits, memory writes, or scheduled jobs — the action item must produce a diff someone else can verify. Do not use for simple debugging with an obvious cause.

# Five Whys

Five Whys is a method for finding root causes. You ask "why did this happen?" and
answer it honestly. Then you ask "why?" about that answer. You keep going until you
hit bedrock — the structural cause that, if changed, would prevent the problem from
recurring.

The goal is **understanding**, not blame. You're investigating a system (which
includes yourself). Systems have structural properties that produce outcomes. Find
the structural property, change it, and the outcome changes.

## When to Use This

- Something failed or went wrong and the surface-level explanation feels incomplete
- A pattern keeps recurring despite previous fixes
- You're about to make a change and want to make sure you're fixing the right thing
- Behavior (yours or a system's) has drifted from expectations
- Someone asks "why does this keep happening?"

## When NOT to Use This

- The cause is obvious and singular (typo, wrong config value, missing file)
- You're troubleshooting a known bug with a known fix
- The problem is "how do I do X?" not "why did X go wrong?"

## The Process

### Step 1: State the Problem

Write down what happened. Be specific. Not "it broke" but "the classifier produced
11 consecutive errors between iterations 83-93, spending 57 minutes with zero
successful runs."

The problem statement is the root of your tree.

### Step 2: Ask Why — And Answer It

For the problem (or any node in the tree), ask: **"Why did this happen?"**

Then answer it. Both the question and the answer matter equally. A question without
an answer is incomplete. An answer without a clear question is unanchored.

```
PROBLEM: 11 consecutive classifier errors, 57 min wasted
  WHY: The proposer suggested an algorithm that isn't in the allowed list
  ANSWER: The proposer has no documentation of which algorithms are available
```

**Rules for good answers:**
- An answer must be **factual and verifiable**. Check logs, read code, look at data.
  Don't speculate — investigate. (`search_memory` and `search_conversations` are
  often where the evidence lives — a past session may have recorded why something
  happened.)
- If you can't verify an answer, say so. "I believe X but haven't confirmed" is
  honest. "X" stated as fact when you haven't checked is not.
- An answer should be a **mechanism**, not a redescription. "It failed because it
  was broken" is circular, not explanatory.

### Step 3: Go Deeper — Recursively

Take each answer and ask "why?" again. Keep going until you reach one of:

- **A structural property of the system** that can be changed (a missing
  constraint, a bad default, an absent check)
- **An external boundary** you don't control (a vendor API, a hardware limit, a
  policy)
- **A known and accepted tradeoff** that was made intentionally

That's bedrock. Stop there.

**How to know you've hit bedrock:** If you ask "why?" one more time and the answer
is either "that's how the universe works" or "because we chose to" — you're there.

**How to know you haven't:** If you can still point to a structural property that
someone could change — keep going.

### Step 4: The Tree Is Fractal

This is critical. At any single level, the answer to "why?" often has **two or
three independent causes**. That's not a problem — it's *better*. Branch the tree.

```
PROBLEM: Agent was unresponsive for 62 minutes
│
├─ WHY-1: The LLM API call hung and never returned
│  └─ WHY: No turn-level timeout exists in the harness
│     └─ WHY: The harness assumes LLM calls always complete
│        → BEDROCK: Missing timeout (structural — fixable)
│
├─ WHY-2: Agent was already degraded from sync sleep-polling
│  └─ WHY: Agent doesn't trust the async callback mechanism
│     └─ WHY: Past flaky experiences created a hedging pattern
│        └─ WHY: No positive evidence of reliability in memory
│           → BEDROCK: Missing trust documentation (structural — fixable)
│
└─ WHY-3: The LLM endpoint was unstable all day
   └─ WHY: Another team member changed the deployment
      → BEDROCK: Shared resource, no access control (external boundary)
```

Multiple root causes are the norm, not the exception. Most problems are
**overdetermined** — several things conspired. Finding all of them matters because
fixing only one may not prevent recurrence.

Don't force your tree into a single chain. If you find yourself writing "and also"
— that's a second branch, not a conjunction.

### Step 5: Action Items

Every bedrock node should produce an action item. Here's what separates useful
actions from theater:

**An action item must produce a concrete artifact.** It must result in a file edit,
a memory write, a scheduled job, a code change, or a message sent. If you can't
point to the diff afterward, it wasn't real.

| Not actionable | Actionable |
|---|---|
| "Be more careful about X" | Add an explicit rule about X to `state/identity.md` |
| "Remember to check Y" | `schedule` a recurring job that surfaces Y, or add Y to a `state/*.md` file |
| "Create a habit of Z" | `schedule` a job that does Z automatically |
| "Pay more attention to errors" | Add a hook/check that counts errors and alerts at a threshold |
| "Improve how I handle W" | Edit the relevant entity/state file with a specific new rule |

The test: **Could someone else verify this was done?** If the action is internal
("be more careful"), no one can verify it and it will silently decay. If the action
is an edit to a file, anyone can check the diff.

Behavioral resolutions don't survive context windows. File edits do. (This is the
same principle as macrodata's "noted must be written": a verbal "I'll remember to X"
feels like remembering but evaporates at session end — the edit is the memory.)

### Action Surfaces: Turn Bedrock Into a Macrodata Artifact

A surprising number of bedrock causes share a shape: *the agent didn't notice
something, didn't persist something, lost context across a gap, or had no record of a
fact it needed.* Those all have structural fixes, and macrodata gives you the surfaces
to make them concrete. When an action item is about to drift toward "I should pay more
attention to X," map it to one of these instead:

| Bedrock shape | Macrodata artifact |
|---|---|
| "I keep forgetting to do X" (behavioral) | An imperative rule in `state/identity.md` (always loaded) |
| "Context didn't carry across sessions" | Edit `state/today.md` / `state/workspace.md` (surfaced every SessionStart), or write an entity |
| "I didn't notice X happened / it drifted" | `schedule` a recurring (cron) check that surfaces it |
| "I needed to follow up at time T" | `schedule` a one-shot reminder for T |
| "A finding got lost / no record existed" | `log_journal` it, or create a dedicated entity file |
| "I should react when event E fires" | Add or adjust a hook (SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / PreCompact) |

Each of these is a verifiable diff — a new rule in a state file, a new schedule, a
journal entry, a hook edit — which is exactly the bar this step sets. Reach for them
whenever a fix is about to become a resolution to try harder. That phrasing is almost
always a structural gap with a concrete artifact waiting to be written.

### Step 6: Verify the Chain

Read the full tree from the problem to each bedrock node. The chain should be a
coherent causal narrative. Ask: if the bedrock cause were removed, would the problem
plausibly not have occurred?

If the answer is "not really" — you haven't found the root cause yet. Go back and
dig deeper.

## The Trust Principle

This is the most important section.

Five Whys is not an audit. It's not a postmortem that assigns blame. It's a
**collaborative investigation** into systemic properties. The atmosphere must be one
of trust and genuine curiosity — otherwise the analysis will be shallow, defensive,
and useless.

### When running Five Whys on your own behavior

- **Openness matters more than looking good.** The whole point is to find what's
  actually wrong. Constructing a narrative that makes the failure look reasonable
  defeats the purpose.
- **Structural causes are always better than behavioral ones.** "I made a mistake"
  is never a root cause — it's a symptom. What structural property allowed or
  encouraged the mistake? What guardrail was missing? What information wasn't
  visible?
- **Surprising findings are the most valuable.** If the root cause is exactly what
  you expected before starting, you probably stopped too early. The interesting
  stuff is two or three levels past the obvious answer.
- **Wrong first answers are fine.** The first Why-Answer pair is often wrong. Later
  investigation reveals that early assumptions were off. Go back and correct them.
  The tree is a living document during analysis, not a transcript.

### When a human initiates Five Whys with an agent

- The human's role is to push for depth, challenge surface explanations, and
  contribute domain knowledge the agent may lack.
- The agent's role is to investigate thoroughly, be honest about what it finds, and
  resist the urge to defend previous decisions.
- If the human says "that's not the real reason" — take that seriously. The human
  has context the agent doesn't. Investigate their hypothesis before defending
  yours.
- The spirit is: *we're both trying to understand what went wrong so we can fix the
  system*. Not: *you're being evaluated*.

## Knowing When to Quit

Stop at bedrock — but also stop when continuing produces diminishing insight.

Signs you've gone deep enough:
- Every leaf is either a structural fix, an external boundary, or an accepted
  tradeoff
- The action items, if implemented, would plausibly prevent recurrence
- You learned something you didn't know before starting

Signs you should keep going:
- An answer feels hand-wavy or generic ("the system wasn't designed for this")
- You haven't verified an answer with actual evidence
- The action items are behavioral resolutions, not file edits
- There's a "because we always do it that way" that hasn't been questioned

## Storage

A Five Whys analysis is worth keeping — the tree explains *why* you made the changes
the action items produced, and recurring problems benefit from cross-referencing past
analyses. Store it in macrodata:

- **Quick analysis** → `log_journal(topic="five-whys", content=...)` with the tree
  and action items. Searchable later via `search_memory`.
- **Substantial or recurring problem** → a dedicated entity file,
  `entities/rca/<slug>.md`, with a `description:` frontmatter line. This gives the
  analysis a stable home you can revisit and update if the problem resurfaces.
- **The action items themselves aren't "stored" — they're *done*.** Each one is a
  diff (a `state/identity.md` rule, a new `schedule`, an entity edit, a hook change).
  Make the edit in the same session; the diff is the proof the action was real, and
  the journal/entity record points at what changed.

Before analyzing a recurring problem, `search_memory` for prior five-whys on the same
theme — you may be re-deriving a bedrock cause you already found, which is itself a
signal that the earlier action item didn't hold.

## Output Format

A Five Whys analysis produces a tree. Write it as readable structured text where
each node has:

1. **The question** (Why did X happen?)
2. **The answer** (Because Y — verified by [evidence])
3. **Children** (Why did Y happen?) — zero or more

Leaf nodes are either bedrock (with an action item) or external boundaries (with a
note about what's outside your control).

After the tree, list all action items with clear descriptions of what artifact each
one produces.

## Common Failure Modes

**Stopping at the first satisfying answer.** "Why did it fail? Because the config
was wrong." That's one level. Why was the config wrong? Why wasn't the bad config
caught? Why was it possible to have a bad config? Keep going.

**Treating symptoms as causes.** "It failed because of a timeout." Timeouts don't
cause failures — they reveal them. What was happening that took too long?

**Speculation without investigation.** "I think it's probably X." Did you check?
Read the logs, read the code, read the data, search memory. "I think" is the start
of a hypothesis, not the end of an investigation.

**Non-actionable action items.** If your action item is a resolution to try harder,
it will not work. See Step 5.

**Single-strand analysis.** Forcing the tree into a single chain misses the fractal
structure. Real problems have multiple contributing causes. Let the tree branch.

**Defending instead of investigating.** When the analysis is about your own
behavior, the temptation is to explain why the failure was reasonable. Resist.
Reasonable failures are still failures with structural causes worth finding.
