/**
 * Ambient-recall async worker.
 *
 * Long-lived process that runs the SLOW pipeline off the hook's blocking path.
 * The hook drops a request file; this worker reranks and writes an inbox file;
 * the hook drains the inbox on its NEXT fire. That's 3fz's competitive
 * injection: a slow hit defers to the next opportunity instead of stalling the
 * current tool call.
 *
 * Why this shape (profiled 2026-06-17): rerank dominates at ~127ms/doc × ~40
 * candidates ≈ 5s; vector+fts+corpus ≈ 320ms. Moving the rerank off the tool
 * round-trip is the whole win. A long-lived worker also amortizes the
 * per-process FTS corpus build (~160ms) and owns the in-process models
 * (models.ts singletons) — the ONLY process that loads them; the hook never does.
 *
 * Protocol (all files live in the mailbox dir, keyed by session_id):
 *   hook  writes  request-<sid>.json  {sid, search, rerankQuery, ts}
 *   worker reads+deletes the request, reranks, writes
 *          inbox-<sid>.json  {ts, hits: SearchResult[]}
 *   hook  reads+deletes the inbox on its next fire and injects.
 * In-context exclude: the worker excludes chunks the hook says are already in
 * context by reading exclude-<sid>.json (the hook computes the window-scoped
 * delta∪frozen set each fire; the worker just consumes it).
 *
 * Run:  bun run src/recall/worker.ts   (foreground; bin/macrodata-hook.sh daemonizes it)
 *
 * The hook appends `--macrodata-recall-worker <state root>` to that command
 * line. Nothing here parses them — not even the root, which this process
 * resolves through getStateRoot() like every other entry point. They exist so
 * the hook can identify its own workers in `ps` without matching a source path
 * that changes with every plugin version. Dropping them makes every worker
 * unreapable.
 *
 * Exactly one worker serves a state root: the first thing this process does is
 * claim <root>/.recall/worker.pid, and a process that loses the claim exits
 * before it can load a model.
