/**
 * macrodata-hook.sh — ambient-recall worker version lifecycle.
 *
 * The hook identifies workers by `ps` argv (sentinel + state root), and decides
 * what to do with each by WHERE its source lives. These tests pin that
 * classification, because the failure it guards against is invisible from the
 * outside: a worker running a different copy of the source looks exactly like a
 * healthy one, which is how an upgraded plugin can serve recall from code the
 * release does not contain.
 *
 * Every test points MACRODATA_ROOT at a temp dir, so the fakes here can never be
 * confused with a worker serving a real store — the hook only ever counts workers
 * whose argv names its own root.
