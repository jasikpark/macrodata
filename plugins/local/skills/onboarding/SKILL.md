# Onboarding Skill

Guide new users through initial macrodata setup.

## When to Use

- `get_context` returns `isFirstRun: true`
- User explicitly asks to set up or reset their profile
- State files are empty or missing

## Onboarding Flow

### Phase 1: Location

Ask where to store macrodata files. Suggest accessible locations:

1. `~/Documents/macrodata` (easy to find)
2. `~/Repos/macrodata` or `~/code/macrodata` (if they use a code folder)
3. `~/.config/macrodata` (default, hidden)

If they choose a non-default location, note that they'll need to set `MACRODATA_ROOT` in their environment.

### Phase 2: Human Profile

Gather information about the user:

**Basics:**
- What should I call you?
- What's your GitHub username?
- Bluesky handle? (optional)
- Other socials or ways to reach you?

**Communication style:**
If they consent, analyze their Claude Code session history (`~/.claude/projects/`):

```bash
# Extract human messages from session history
find ~/.claude/projects -name "*.jsonl" -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null | \
  jq -r 'select(.type == "human") | .message.content' 2>/dev/null | \
  head -200
```

Look for patterns:
- Message length (short/direct vs detailed)
- Tone (casual, formal, technical)
- How they give feedback (direct corrections, suggestions, questions)
- British vs American spelling

**Working patterns:**
- What are you currently working on?
- Any preferences for how the agent should work?

Write findings to `state/human.md`:

```markdown
# Human Profile

## Basics
- **Name:** [name]
- **GitHub:** [username]
- **Bluesky:** [handle]

## Communication Style
- [observed patterns from analysis]
- [stated preferences]

## Working Patterns
- [current focus areas]
- [preferences]

## Pending Items
- [empty initially]
```

### Phase 3: Agent Identity

Help define who the agent should be:

**Name and persona:**
- What should the agent be called?
- What's its role? (assistant, partner, specialist)
- Any personality traits?

**Values and patterns:**
- What behaviors should it prioritize?
- How proactive should it be?

Write to `identity.md`:

```markdown
# [Agent Name] Identity

## Persona
[Description of who the agent is, its role, personality]

## Values
- [core value 1]
- [core value 2]

## Patterns
- [behavioral pattern 1]
- [behavioral pattern 2]
```

### Phase 4: Initial Workspace

Set up working context:

1. Ask what they're currently working on
2. Create initial project files in `entities/projects/`
3. Write `state/today.md` with current context
4. Write `state/workspace.md` with active projects

```markdown
# Today

## Now
[Current context from conversation]

## Context
[Background information]
```

```markdown
# Workspace

## Active Projects
- [project 1] - [brief description]

## Open Threads
- [things in progress]
```

### Phase 5: Finalize

1. Rebuild the memory index with `rebuild_memory_index`
2. Log completion to journal
3. Summarize what was created
4. Suggest next steps

## Session History Analysis

If the user consents, analyze their Claude Code history for communication patterns:

```bash
# Count messages and get stats
find ~/.claude/projects -name "*.jsonl" -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null | \
  jq -r 'select(.type == "human") | .message.content' 2>/dev/null | \
  awk '{print length}' | \
  sort -n | \
  awk '{sum+=$1; a[NR]=$1} END {print "Messages:", NR, "Median:", a[int(NR/2)], "Avg:", int(sum/NR)}'
```

**Useful patterns to extract:**
- Message length distribution (short = direct communicator)
- Greeting patterns (casual vs formal)
- How they give corrections ("no" vs "actually" vs questions)
- Technical depth (jargon usage)
- British vs American English

Summarize only actionable patterns for the human profile.

## Example Conversation

**Agent:** Welcome to macrodata! Let's get you set up.

First, where would you like me to store your memory files?
1. `~/Documents/macrodata` (easy to find in Finder)
2. `~/Repos/macrodata` (with your code)
3. `~/.config/macrodata` (hidden, default)

**User:** Documents is fine

**Agent:** Got it. Now, what should I call you?

**User:** Matt

**Agent:** Nice to meet you, Matt. What's your GitHub username?

**User:** ascorbic

**Agent:** And a Bluesky handle, if you have one?

**User:** mk.gg

**Agent:** Great. Would you like me to analyze your Claude Code session history to understand your communication style? I'll look at things like message length, tone, and how you prefer to give feedback. This stays completely local.

**User:** Sure

**Agent:** [runs analysis, summarizes findings]

Looking at your history, I can see you communicate in short, direct messages (median 67 chars), use British English, and give quick acknowledgments ("ok", "yeah"). You tend to ask questions before committing to an approach, and corrections are direct. I'll keep that in mind.

Now, what would you like to call your agent?
