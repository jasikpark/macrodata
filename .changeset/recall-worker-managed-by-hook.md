"macrodata": patch
---

Manage the ambient-recall worker from `macrodata-hook.sh`, on both hook events, so a
plugin update takes effect without waiting for a new session. The worker had its own
SessionStart-only supervisor, and SessionStart does not fire on `/plugin update` +
`/reload-plugins` — so the pass that reaps the previous version's worker only ran once
a session happened to open, and until then a freshly installed release kept serving
recall from the old cached code. The daemon already converged on every prompt; the
worker now does too, through the same verified-kill path. Per-prompt passes stay silent
unless they act, so neither the model's context nor the log gets a line per message.

Converging on every prompt also means concurrent sessions can observe the same
worker-less window and spawn into it together, so the worker now claims
`.recall/worker.pid` before it can load a model and stands down if another process
already serves that state root. A claim whose process is gone is taken over rather
than obeyed — the hook stops a stale-version worker with SIGKILL, which never gets to
clean up after itself. A reboot restarts the PID space from the bottom, where a
surviving claim can name an unrelated live process and mute recall for good, so the
hook clears any claim whose holder is not one of the workers `ps` just reported for
that root.
